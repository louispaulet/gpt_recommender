# Brand Identity

This project adopts free, modern typography that emulates the clean, bold aesthetic often associated with FAANG design. The open-source **Inter** typeface gives the interface a professional look while keeping licensing simple. We extend Tailwind with custom design tokens so every component consistently uses the same color palette, spacing units and fonts.

## Analysis

The brand is based on a vibrant yet accessible palette of purple, pink and blue hues. These colors are defined as Tailwind tokens (`brand.primary`, `brand.secondary`, `brand.accent`, `brand.light`, `brand.dark`) and reused throughout the homepage, about page and shared components. Spacing and font tokens ensure layouts look uniform. By centralising these tokens, the app gains a coherent identity that can evolve easily.
